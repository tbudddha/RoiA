RoiA is an ImageJ Macro originally designed to help experimenters identify and draw ROIs around probesites in fixed brain sections. The code was tested on ~8000
images of rat brain tissue implanted with different cannulae. Despite this specific test case, the code itself can be applied to largely any tissue type and relies primarily
on a reference channel (often DAPI) as well as blank pixels (or at least pixels that can be thresholded blank) that comprise the 'site'. Within this repository you can find the 
macro code as well as a python script to organize the subsequent Excel output generated by RoiA.
